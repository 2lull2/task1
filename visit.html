    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>Act 1</h2>
    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p>Two households both alike in dignity.
    In far Verona, where we lay our scene,    
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins jf these two foes
    A pair of star-crossd lovers take there life,
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    Do with there death bury there parents strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-marked love,
    And the countinuance of their parents rage,
    Which, but their childrens end, nougth could remove,
    Is now the two hours traffic of our stage.
    The which if you with patient ears attend.
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>   
   
    <p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p>
<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and buklers  </p>
